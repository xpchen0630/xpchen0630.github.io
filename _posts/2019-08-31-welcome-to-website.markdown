## Jekyll & EasyBook ##

This site is built on [Jekyll][jekyll]. A template named [EasyBook][github-easybook] is also used which offers me more choices to improve the site.

Below is the description of Jekyll on its [official website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

> Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.

GitHub Flavored Markdown is supported.

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

And $$\mathcal{ Mathematics }$$ is supported!

Use `$$` to wrap the formulas. For example, `$$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $$` displays $$  e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0  $$

Multi-line formulas are supported too.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& J(w, b) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}L(\hat{y}^{(i)}, y^{(i)})
+ \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{l=1}^{L}{||w||}^2_F\\\\
& {||w||}^2_F = \sum_{i = 1}^{n[l]}\sum_{j = 1}^{n[l-1]}(w_{ij})^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].

I'm using [EasyBook][github-easybook] the template from [laobubu.net](http://laobubu.net) as well which has some advanced functions. Some features are supported now:

> * **Pagination** is enabled.
> * **Disqus** or **多说** is ready.
> * **TOC** for posts is enabled.
> * **Profile** including your links and avatar on the sidebar.
> * *And more...*

The template is for free. We can support the developers of [EasyBook][github-easybook] by the following ways:
